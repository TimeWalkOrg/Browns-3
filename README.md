## Building History
This building was built in 1939 and known as Brown’s Furniture Store. It was a wide building with large wide windows on the first floor and smaller windows on the second floor. This buildings was used to sell furniture to local customers. There is not a lot of information about this building, except for an image of the front of the store. The building is now the Balboa Cafe, but the current building does not have a similar appearance to Brown’s Furniture store because many buildings were built on the same lot as Brown’s over years.
